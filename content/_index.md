Hello hitchhiker of internet! Welcome to The Cyber Society, my personal corner of the web. This site is meant to share my projects and passion related  to all things cyber! I’ve always wanted to create a space like this but never quite found the time—if you’re reading this, then I guess I finally got it right.

I have a backlog of projects I want to share related to cybersecurity, homelab, automation, etc..
